By analyzing such data I would be able to determine where the restaurant will be able to attract more people since this type of restaurants typically has a well-defined target population. By setting up the restaurant on the right spot we will be spending less on advertisement since our market niche is close, for example, and set prices according to it."

On a later stage Foursquare data was used to locate were the peers were. SEgmentation here was fundamental, by using an unsupervised ML method, K-means, I was able to find the best spot."

Even though we would think we should open a restaurant right next to where the target client is located, this was not the final conclusion. The restaurant should open next to the other restaurants as this has proven to be the favorite area for people to go. Of course I could have extended the model and analyzed more variables that also impact the decision like the parking spots around, public transports and connection, etc. However this was a fun, short but insightful project."
